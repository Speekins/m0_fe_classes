# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
  This was certainly a challenge. I've never worked with Javascript Classes before. But considering how much we've already learned I knew I would be able to figure it out and leaned on a lot of the information we had already learned through mod0.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
  I think it's going well. I have my set times of the day when I try to get things done. That ebbs and flows since not every day works out exactly as planned. But so far so good and I think this routine is going to work going into Mod 1.
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
  I've got most things ironed out in regards to my schedule, routine, home, family, and technical aspects. I just have a few housekeeping items to attend to.
